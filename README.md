This is a basic site that gives the "lazy" path to having a retirement through 401k.

DISCLAIMER - This is not professional financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own research as well.

In my experience most people in their early to mid and even late twenties, don't think about their retirement. Also, when they do start to question retirement they don't know what to do.

This is for people who just want an "easy" answer and not want to really think to hard about it.

Its 3 steps:

Step 1 - Obtain a job that offers 401k and work towards maxing out the annual max contribution limit.

Step 2 - While working towards the max contribution limit, also put some away for savings to act as an emergency savings fund that will last you 6 months in the case of an EMERGENCY

Step 3 (optional) - The first 2 steps, based on 50 years of past market performance, and consistently contributing to 401k until you retire should net you around at least 1 million. This last step which is optional is that you can open a personal IRA or portfolio with a brokerage and invest in which ever company you believe will maximize your returns
